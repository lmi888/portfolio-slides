  <div class="about">
     <p>It all started with a search for cat-safe plants. When I have enough knowledge, I plan on creating a website that will list all cat-safe houseplants, be searchable, and have large photos which will make identification of plants easy when out and about plant shopping. This means a well-written and designed mobile site, as well as desktop. Care instructions will be included too!  I have big ideas for this project and I know it will be something to be proud of once it's completed. </p>

     <p>Once upon a time, somewhere around 14 years ago, I was a contractor for a large computer company. There I did some sysadmin and hardware work, but I had the most fun doing HTML, XML and XSLT in their webmasters department.

       I'm currently taking Colt Steele's Web Development class at Udemy and the Web Developer class at FreeCodeCamp. I have always been interested in, and am still having fun with HTML and CSS!  I plan to study Python in depth, and will be taking Javascript classes as well.</p>

     <p> On the non-computing side I have a multitude of creative outlets, from mosaic to origami to cross-stitch! The one I've stuck to the most though, has been crochet. I was taught how to crochet by my grandmother when I was a little girl, and I've been at it ever since.</p>
     <p>I am owned by two beautiful cats, King Tut and Loki. Here's their board on <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/SingingFrog/my-cats-3/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>.</p>
